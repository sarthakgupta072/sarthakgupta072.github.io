      <description>About I am presently working as a software developer at Intuit, where I am working on one of their products known as QuickBooks Desktop Payroll. It has been a wonderful experience working at Intuit till now. :smile:
Other than my day job at Intuit, I am an active contributor in open source. Presently, I am working with an organization called elixir-cloud-aai which comes under the umbrella of organization called GA4GH. I was selected in Google Summer of Code under this organization and have stayed connected with it till date.</description>
